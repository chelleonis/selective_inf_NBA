fucntions - These compute p-values and selection intervals

forwardstepinf(x,y) forward  stepwise regression (AIC stoppign rule)
fixedLassoinf(x,y) fixed lambda lasso 
larInf(x,y) least angle regression

focus on lasso as a selection procedure


False discovery rates??? FDR - benjamini and hochberg

appropriate intermediate way of controlling for the inflated type I error in large
studies. If one uses regular Î±-level testing in order to tag R discoveries (where
a discovery is a rejected null hypothesis) among the m tested, then the number
of false discoveries being made, denoted by V , may become very high.
